      <h1>Calissa Tyrrell</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Calissa and I am currently a junior at Del Norte. My favorite class at Del Norte is probably AP Computer
    <br> Science, probably because its the most interesting. To be honest though, I'm not very good at it. <br> </p>

    <p>I also have a lot of hobbies. I play basketball year-round, enjoy gardening, playing video games, as well as eating. Yes, eating is a hobby.
        I'd say there is a special art to good food. Yummy food (especially Italian food) is probably what I am most passionate about in regards to hobbies.</p>
